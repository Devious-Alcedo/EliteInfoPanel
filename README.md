EliteInfoPanel
Coming soon to a small display on your desk! The goal is a mulit-functional display to help commanders with colonization efforts, and to provide easily accessible visual information whether on foot, in ship, SRV, figter or a wing!
Current progress:

* In Ship - mainly complete, provided route information, cargo information, statuses and fuel info
* Carrier Cargo - Provides a mechanic for tracking cargo - you will need to initially update the carrier cargo manually either by editin gthe Fleet Carrier Cargo Card, or by transferring cargo to a ship, then back to the carrier 
* Colonisation Tracking - mainly complete, but can only currently track one colonisation effort at a time (future enhancement)
* Ability to export Tracking Data to CSV
* Can pop out colinization card and fleet carrier cargo card
* On Foot backpack in development
