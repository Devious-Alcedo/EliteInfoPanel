# Elite Info Panel Performance Fixes

## Issue Analysis

Your Elite Info Panel app was experiencing sluggishness over time due to several performance issues in the file monitoring system (not serial ports, but Elite Dangerous file watchers). The app monitors journal files and game status files for real-time updates.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **File Watcher Accumulation**: Multiple FileSystemWatcher objects were being created without proper disposal
2. **Excessive Property Change Notifications**: High-frequency updates causing UI thread bottlenecks  
3. **Memory Leaks**: Various collections and timers not being cleaned up properly
4. **Journal Processing Inefficiency**: Reading journal files line-by-line without buffering
5. **Unthrottled MQTT Publishing**: Network operations on every file change
6. **Missing Resource Disposal**: No IDisposable implementation for cleanup

## Fixes Applied

### 1. File Watcher Management (FIX 1-3)
- **Changed**: `List<FileSystemWatcher>` â†’ `ConcurrentDictionary<string, FileSystemWatcher>`
- **Added**: Proper disposal and error handling for all watchers
- **Added**: Cleanup timer and disposal tracking

### 2. Property Change Throttling (FIX 4-6) 
- **Added**: Throttling system for high-frequency properties (countdown timers, fuel levels)
- **Added**: Property change buffer to batch notifications
- **Reduced**: UI thread pressure from constant updates

### 3. Journal Processing Optimization (FIX 7-8)
- **Added**: Journal processing buffer to reduce file I/O
- **Added**: Timer-based batch processing instead of immediate processing
- **Improved**: File access patterns with better error recovery

### 4. Memory Management (FIX 9-11)
- **Added**: Periodic cleanup timer (every 10 minutes)
- **Added**: Automatic cleanup of expired manual cargo changes
- **Added**: Route progress data pruning to prevent memory growth
- **Added**: Forced garbage collection when memory usage is high

### 5. Error Handling & Recovery (FIX 12-14)
- **Added**: Automatic file watcher recreation on errors
- **Added**: Comprehensive exception handling for all async operations
- **Added**: Graceful degradation when file access fails

### 6. Resource Disposal (FIX 15-16)
- **Implemented**: IDisposable pattern for GameStateService
- **Added**: Proper disposal of all timers, watchers, and resources
- **Updated**: MainWindow to dispose GameStateService on closing

## Files Modified

### 1. GameStateService_Fixed.cs (New optimized version)
```csharp
// Key improvements:
- Implements IDisposable
- Uses ConcurrentDictionary for thread-safe watcher management
- Adds cleanup timers and throttling systems
- Improved error handling and recovery
```

### 2. MainWindow.xaml.cs (Updated)
```csharp
// In MainWindow_Closing method:
if (_gameState is IDisposable disposableGameState)
{
    disposableGameState.Dispose();
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Backup your current GameStateService.cs**
2. **Replace GameStateService.cs with GameStateService_Fixed.cs** 
3. **The MainWindow.xaml.cs fix has already been applied**
4. **Test the application**

## Expected Results

- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Cleanup timers prevent memory accumulation
- **Smoother Performance**: Throttled updates reduce UI thread pressure  
- **Better Stability**: Error recovery prevents crashes from file access issues
- **Faster Response**: Buffered journal processing reduces I/O bottlenecks
- **No More Sluggishness**: Proper resource disposal prevents the slowdown over time

## Monitoring

You can monitor the improvements by:
- Watching memory usage in Task Manager over time
- Checking the log files (F12) for cleanup messages
- Testing long-running sessions (several hours) for performance

The key fix is that your app will now properly clean up resources, preventing the accumulation of file watchers and memory that was causing the sluggishness.
